# Plant Disease Detection System

![Plant Disease Detection]

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building an automated system that identifies plant diseases from images and provides a detailed diagnosis using a Deep Learning model. The system combines image classification with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to offer expert-level explanations of the identified diseases, helping farmers manage crop health and reduce losses effectively.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Disease Detection:** Automatically classify plant diseases from photos using a deep learning model.
- **Expert-level Diagnosis:** Get detailed, NLP-generated explanations of the diagnosed disease, including treatment options.
- **User-friendly Interface:** A web-based interface for easy interaction, empowering farmers with real-time insights into crop health.

## Technologies Used
- **Deep Learning** (TensorFlow / PyTorch)
- **NLP** (BERT / GPT)
- **Frontend** (Streamlit / Flask)
- **Backend** (Python)

## Project Architecture

![Architecture Diagram]()

The system consists of several key components:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Images are gathered and preprocessed to ensure quality training data.
2. **Model Training:** A deep learning model is trained on labeled plant disease data.
3. **NLP Integration:** An NLP model generates detailed descriptions of each diagnosed disease.
4. **User Interface Development:** The final model is deployed with an intuitive user interface for easy access.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-detection.git
    cd plant-disease-detection
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
